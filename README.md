# RF-Security-Exploration-Arduino-FlipperZero
This Arduino sketch uses RCSwitch library and Flipper Zero to receive and process RF signals. The code listens for a 12-bit CAME protocol fixed code, and turns on an LED when detected. A beginner-friendly foundation for legal exploration of RF security and ethical hacking.
